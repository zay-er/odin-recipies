    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This recipe is a compilation of several British Shortbread cookie recipies.
       The outcome should be buttery and not too sweet. Enjoy the Taste (:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/3 cup white rice flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet with greaseproof (parchment) paper. Sift the flour and rice flour into a medium mixing bowl. 
        Add the sugar and mix.</li>
      <li>Cut butter into pieces and rub into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture begins to bind together. 
        Knead into soft dough.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough into an 8 inch round (or for exact round, mold it in an 8 inch cake pan). Place on baking sheet. Using a fork, prick top and make tine marks along edge. Using a table knife, score top with wedge marks. 
        (This is where it will break when cooled)</li>
      <li>Bake 45 minutes or until pale golden in color. Sprinkle a little superfine sugar over top and cool on baking sheet. Cut into wedges.
         Keeps for weeks in airtight tin.</li>
    </ol>
